# Web-portfolio

This repo contains some / most of my most representative web development work.
Since most of the projects were in my spare time for fun, I did not try my best to document it really well or make clean code. This also caused some projects to be cut off early and they might never have seen a finished state. On the other hand, there are some projects I have done for school, in which I had to try a bit harder, but even in those I would not try to put in too much effort.

## TODO

- There are some folders which miss files since they were lost in my backups. I will have to try and find a method if I can resolve them in a different way.
- The projects should contain some documentation on what and how they work, why they were made and such info.
